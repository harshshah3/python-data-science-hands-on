### Project Overview

Olympics Data Analysis

#### Dataset used from :  [(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table)] - Olympic Games Medal Data

The Olympic Games, considered to be the world's foremost sports competition has more than 200 nations participating across the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.

Throughout this hands-on project,  I have put efforts to have insights on some interesting statistics and then try to find out which country is the King of Olympic Games.

####The dataset has details of 146 countries with following 16 features

| Features | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Country_Name | Name of the country |
| # Summer | No. of games played in Summer Olympics |
| Gold_Summer | No. of gold medals won in Summer Olympics |
| Silver_Summer | No. of silver medals won in Summer Olympics|
| Bronze_Summer | No. of bronze medals won in Summer Olympics |
| Total_Summer | Total no. of all the medals won in Summer Olympics |
| # Winter | No. of games played in Winter Olympics |
| Gold_Winter | No. of goldmedals won in Winter Olympics |
| Silver_Winter | No. of silvermedals won in Winter Olympics |
| Bronze_Winter | No. of bronze medals won in Winter Olympics |
| Total_Winter | Total no. of all the medals won in Winter Olympics |
| # Games | Total no. of games played in both Summer and Winter Olympics |
| Gold_Total | Total no. of gold medals won in both Summer and Winter Olympics |
| Silver_Total	| Total no. of silver medals won in both Summer and Winter Olympics |
| Bronze_Total | Total no. of bronze medals won in both Summer and Winter Olympics |
| Total | Total no. of all the medals won in both Summer and Winter Olympics |

Tasks:

1. Which Event was better in terms of medal counts : Summer or Winter ?
2. Visualizing the top 10 countries in Winter Olympics, Summer Olympics and in both. Which are the common of all three?
3. What is the Gold medal winning ratio with respect to total medals count for top 10 countries?
4. Which country has performed based so far in terms or medals tally?  



### Learnings from the project

#### The major objective behind this hands-on project is to have a better understanding of data handling/wrangling with python(Pandas).

 - Pandas Dataframe operations
 - Conditional Filtering and Lambda expressions
 - List and Set operations
 - Bar Plotting
 - Mathematical operations


## Statistical insights:

- Medal Counts for top 10 performing countries in all Olympic events
