### Project Overview

##Olympics Data Analysis

#### Dataset used from :  [(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table)] - Olympic Games Medal Data

The Olympic Games, considered to be the world's foremost sports competition has more than 200 nations participating across the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.

Throughout this hands-on project,  I have put efforts to have insights on some interesting statistics and then try to find out which country is the King of Olympic Games.

####Tasks:

1. Which Event was better in terms of medal counts : Summer or Winter ?
2. Visualizing the top 10 countries in Winter Olympics, Summer Olympics and in both. Which are the common of all three?
3. What is the Gold medal winning ratio with respect to total medals count for top 10 countries?
4. Which country has performed based so far in terms or medals tally?  



### Learnings from the project

#### The major objective behind this hands-on project is to have a better understanding of data handling/wrangling with python(Pandas).

 - Pandas Dataframe operations
 - Conditional Filtering and Lambda expressions
 - List and Set operations
 - Bar Plotting
 - Mathematical operations


## Statistical insights:
